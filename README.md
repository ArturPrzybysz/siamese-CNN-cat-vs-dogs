##Cats vs dogs using Siamese CNN with Triplet Loss
I treat this project as an introduction to Siamese Networks 
before facing a more sophisticated problem, which I will describe in my
Bachelor thesis.

####Dataset
Dataset consists of 12500 cat and 12500 dogs jpg images.

####Triples construction
TODO: describe, citing paper
